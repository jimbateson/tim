# The Incredible Milk
## Setup

### Clone

## Notes

### Feature ideas
* Filtering
* Animations
* Pull shakes from data (ran out of time to do this in a secure way)
* Cart total indicator for mobile

### Improve/refactor/optimise
* Legacy browser fallbacks (grid, css vars etc)
* Flexbox utilities
* Button utilities/tidy up (a few buttons share common values)
* Unit tests - not something I've had experience with, but should be writing these whilst building functionality
* JavaScript file organisation
